This is a small mock up of what would be a Reddit clone.

I was given the task of doing this for a technical challenge.

Basically what it does is fetch posts from the subreddit /r/pics and displays them.

At the top of the page there is a tab navigator to be able to navigate from tab to tab.

There are 4 tabs that each contain a different type of sort.

Sorts:

1- 'New' sorts the posts by date of creation from newest to oldest

2- 'Top' sorts the posts by amount of upvotes from most voted to least voted

3- 'Hot' sorts the posts by the most upvoted in the last hour

4- 'Controversial' sorts the posts taking in account the amount of upvotes minus the amount of downvotes

You can also click on each post and it will open up a WebView component that shows the image of the post.

I use a stack navigator to be able to navigate from the post image back to the list of posts.
